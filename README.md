🛡️ TruthAI — Autonomous AI for Misinformation Immunity

Hackathon Project | AI-Powered Tool for Combating Misinformation
A next-gen solution to fight misinformation across text, images, videos, memes, and audio while educating users with trust, transparency, and privacy.

🌍 Problem Statement

Misinformation is spreading faster than truth across social media, WhatsApp forwards, memes, and videos.

Existing fact-checkers are text-only, reactive, and slow.

People often get flagged but not educated.

Current tools don’t protect privacy and lack scalability.

💡 Our Solution — TruthAI

TruthAI is a multi-modal, community-driven misinformation shield that goes beyond flagging.
It:

Detects & verifies across text, images, videos, memes, and audio.

Builds a Global Truth Graph (blockchain-backed) to link every claim with evidence.

Uses Counterfactual Generators to show “what if this were true” → educates instead of banning.

Empowers users with gamified misinformation immunity boosters.

Preserves user privacy with zero-knowledge proofs and transparent logs.

🚀 Core Features

✔ Multi-Modal Fact-Checking — Text, audio, image, video, meme verification.
✔ Global Truth Graph — Blockchain + knowledge graph of claims & evidence.
✔ Community Trust Nodes — DAO-based peer validation with hidden reputation scores.
✔ Counterfactual Generator — Educates instead of censoring.
✔ Gamified Popups — “Immunity boosters” that teach misinformation literacy.
✔ Privacy Preserving — Zero-knowledge proofs to ensure fairness.
✔ APIs & Extensions — Plugins for WhatsApp, Telegram, browsers, and schools.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js (Web), Flutter (Mobile)
Backend: Node.js + Express, Firebase Functions
Database: Firebase Firestore (real-time), Neo4j (knowledge graph)
AI/ML:

Google Gemini/PaLM 2 → NLP & misinformation detection

Google Cloud Vision API → Image/video verification

Whisper / Google Speech-to-Text → Audio analysis

TensorFlow → Fake media detection
Blockchain: Polygon / Hyperledger for claim fingerprinting
Cloud Services: Firebase Auth, Firebase Hosting, Firebase Analytics

🔄 Workflow

User submits content (or system scans via plugin).

AI extracts claim → cross-checks across trusted databases (Google FactCheck, News APIs, Wikipedia).

Truth Score (0–100) is generated.

If misinformation → AI generates counterfactual & interactive popup.

Results logged on blockchain, community validates via DAO.

📊 Business Model

Freemium App → free for individuals, premium for NGOs/schools.

SaaS API → integrations with WhatsApp, Telegram, browsers.

Government Licensing → election monitoring, misinformation dashboards.

Corporate Model → employee misinformation literacy programs.

📈 Impact & Scalability

Reduces misinformation virality across multiple platforms.

Educates instead of censoring → psychological resilience.

Scales globally via APIs, plugins, and blockchain-backed transparency.

🎯 Future Scope

Real-time misinformation heatmaps for regions.

AR/VR explainers for immersive learning.

AI “personal misinformation shields” for every user.
